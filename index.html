                        Having Downloaded TFC of the night of its release, and then loving being a demo in CZ2 and pissing people of as a Pyro I decided to join a clan. Looking through the WPTFC message board came up with a post by Badger about a new clan called TPC. I Had a
                        trial the day later with Slog on some crappy Map I never ever played before and I just about managed to impress him by burning him many times =)

                        Originally got into online gaming via quake and quakeworld thru gamespy. Started playing HL firstly on the net again thru gamespy, downloaded TFC as soon as it came out and was hooked. Did not try it on wireplay until the day it became free! When TPC
                        first started recruiting I thought it would be fun and sent an e-mail to sign up. Luckily slog and badger had already noticed me on the servers and welcomed me aboard without a trial. Its been onward and upward ever since, maturing
                        into a friendly strong well organised clan.

                        I was a keen WP user with racing simulations but wanted a game where I could get regular opposition. I bought Half-Life as my first 3D-shooter and hated it until I discovered TFC. I became a regular WP server player. Many people came online advertising
                        for players but I wanted someone to ask me specifically if I wanted to join. Badger was the first person to ask...and so here I am :o)

                        Was keen player of Quake 2 on Wireplay, heard from my mate that Half Life TFC was the shit. Tried it and fell in love. Posted on message board to see if any clans where recruiting - no replies ;o) looked at clan list on Wireplay and found the ThePooCrew
                        site, was inspired by there passion for poo and asked for a trial, and the rest is history.

                        Well, I started playing TFC at a local LAN with some mates. Liked TFC so played it online. Played on loads of net servers and at the time loved hunted as sniper. Stumbled across WP TFC forum and posted a reply to a recruitment message by Badger. Went
                        for a trial and the rest is history.

                        As you may well know TPC have not been very active over the last few months. We are trying to get active enough again to put in a decent effort in the next WPTFCL. So wake up people!

                        With the imminent start of the restored WPTFCL, the clan machine rumbled and roared back to life with our first friendly of 2002. Sporting a new member, Mad Mada McMad of the clan Mc Adam, TPC clicked on the cruise control and eased out onto the TFC highway
                        heading towards shutdown2, and promptly ran over clan GF5. Despite their valiant attempts to leap out of the way, we hit them at 130 miles an hour, scattering offensive engy's and Decrepid^Soldiers everywhere. Our frontline defence
                        directed the oncoming GF5 traffic towards the scrap heap with K1llz excelling himself by racking up an impressive 86...erm kills. The trip to monkey told a similar story but with GF5 grabbing a cap. This was in spite of our def
                        setting up a roadblock around our flag on the bridge and getting carried away after the instruction to "hold it up a bit" was taken to the extreme. <img src="images/news/big_grin.gif" /> TPC was later convicted
                        of having an Offence (good) and got 260 points on it's licence. Win vs [GF5] shutdown2 130-0 monkey_l 130-10

                        We played MDB yesterday in the BWTFCL div1 semi-final and lost a close match 50-60 Openfire and 20-20 2Fort. A very good game which I enjoyed a lot even though we lost. 2fort was very exciting with some wicked defending keeping the score to 20. SG balc.
                        <img src="images/news/big_grin.gif" /> Openfire was a shambles but a spirited comeback kept MDB on their toes. Good luck MDB in the final vs LP, make sure you beat that "funny" clan.

                        Monday we played |Gla| in CB ladder, won 2fort on our server 60-20, gg. moved over to their server based in Italy and the lag was horrid, they were always leading so towards end we put some more on def to get win overall which I don't think they liked,
                        lost Openfire 50-20 (80-70 win overall).
                        <br />
                        <br /> Tuesday we played another CB ladder game, this time against [koSm]. they got quick cap and about half way through map dragged out another flag, lost 2fort 20-0. play stow next, we gain a 20 point lead and map is going to end soon,
                        so desperate to keep the 20 point lead we chase flag outside, basically 8v8 dm on bridge, unfortunately they finally get their cap and map ends seconds later, won 40-30 (50-40 loss overall).
                        <br />
                        <br /> Wednesday we played [A&amp;I] in BW league playoffs. We win 2Fort comfortably 80-10. CO2 next and its very tense, scores are very close and Doe drops, they don't idle (like we had for them) and take advantage of our weakened def
                        to get a 2 cap lead, we come back with another cap but it's too late, loss 120-110. Draw so it goes to CZ2, I was confidant due to our recent results on it, at first its close but gradually we pull away and cap all points twice,
                        won 189-78.

                        Our BWTFCL game this week was versus MI-CSC-RNK and saw our first convincing win of the season. Shutdown2 was first and our offy chaps wasted no time in capping as we raced to a 30-0 start. At this point MCR managed to get our lasers, grab the flag, and
                        almost made it to the front door in one swift move. We battled hard to keep it for what seemed like an age. MCR got the flag to the front door, only to have the sg fire their flag carrier back into the far corner of the entrance.
                        Sneaky work by their train riding spy finally de-railed our manic defence and they capped making it 40-10. And although MCR did get our flag to the bottom of the flag room ramp at one point, our defence remained fairly solid. Meanwhile
                        our offence had kept the pressure on and secured another 3 caps. Openfire was next and the def lads put on a first class performance that allowed the flag merely inches out of the lasers on one occasion to give us a clean sheet.
                        Our offence got an early touch but took a little while to cap as MCR put up a determined fight. With another man sent forward, we started to make some headway and 3 more caps followed in the second half of the map. Although both
                        teams had players drop as pings started to rise, it was a very good natured, fun game. Win sd2/70-10 of/40-0.
                        <br />
                        <br /> On Wednesday we faced K20 in the Jolts' Kings of 2fort Tournament. The knockout is played over a single map per round with games ending in a draw being decided by which team had the least deaths.
                        <img src="images/news/oh_well.gif" /> We expected a tough game, and that's what we got. Our defence was in shambles mode almost immediately as our lift solly lagged and finally dropped leaving us exposed. However, our offence capped
                        first, in what turned into one of the most exciting to-and-fro games of 2fort we've ever had. The cap list reading: 1-0, 1-1, 1-2, 2-2, 3-2, 3-3, 4-3, 5-3, 5-4, 6-4, 6-5. The game ended with us defending our flag at the top respawn
                        after K20 touched it 14 times in the last 3 minutes. Had the match been decided on deaths, we would have lost 242-217. <img src="images/news/oh_well.gif" /> It was a highly enjoyable game from start to finish and we&#8217;d like
                        to thank K20 for their honourable play. Win 2fort/60-50. The next round gives us an easy game versus UE. <img src="images/news/wink.gif" />
                        <br />
                        <br /> Our friendly vs MDB this week was another absolute corker of a match. <img src="images/news/big_grin.gif" /> Stowaway was first up, although we experienced a false start after t!mo locked himself in a respawn with another young
                        man and refused to come out. After the restart, the game ran to a similar formula as the K20 match only minutes before. We capped first, only to have our defence shown to be rather leaky as we were 30-10 down after 15mins. A minor
                        shuffle in our defence and continued pressure by our offence saw us come back to lead 40-30 at the 25 minute mark. MDB capped shortly afterwards to square things, and this led into the manic final 3 minutes. Once again we found
                        our flag out and into the ramp room where a ferocious battle began. It was waged at first with rockets and nails, but as MDB dragged our flag kicking and screaming to the main entrance, we started throwing knives, forks plastic
                        belt buckles, and empty cans of deodorant. We valiantly held out but soon the only things we had left were either stuck, screwed or nailed down, and MDB finally capped as Doe fired our last elastic band. Twenty seconds later, our
                        offence had their flag at their main entrance and Hope glimmered brilliantly. Brushing Hope aside, (this was no place for a woman), we sent wave after wave of brave attackers who had to face relentless grenade and rocket attack
                        as they slowly but surely moved the flag out until it was in the water. At this point MDB starting throwing everything back at us that we had thrown at them, which was lucky because it meant I got my watch back (I hadn&#8217;t
                        meant to throw that in the first place). Almost every member of both teams seemed to be outside as we battled to get the flag that short distance from the water to the cap point. Finally, as the seconds ticked away, Doe grabbed
                        the flag, rj&#8217;d up and met me nose to nose at the end of our balcony, only to have me TK him with a lagged EMP as my poor pute struggled with the melee. The game ended a fraction of a second later with not even enough time
                        for me to pick up the flag that was at my feet and take it the few paces to the cap point. <img src="images/news/frown.gif" /> The second map, which was monkey, was crap. <img src="images/news/big_grin.gif" /> A first class match.
                        Loss stow/50-40 monkey/100-70.

                        <br />
                        <br /> We played our first game in BWTFCL vs the German clan LP| which proved to be a chore. Backtracking soldiers &amp; heavy mid map DMing was nasty enough, but the 6 man defence once we got their flag moving made for 2 very poor quality
                        games. We weren't prepared for that kind of low level gaming to be going on in Division 1, but we won't be caught out again. Loss stow/60-30 2fort/30-10.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Our second BWTFCL game vs XXX was an entirely different affair. We hadn't played them before and we weren't sure what to expect. Two good, well mannered matches followed despite the servers poor performance at times. On Well our
                        flag was in the ramp room and then outside our respawn for ages, when the server slowed to a deadstop. I dropped, taking our front door sg with me <img src="images/news/frown.gif" /> and XXX capitalised as the server crawled back
                        to life to grab the cap. Sometime later after a raging battle to get their flag from the ramp room to the front door we capped back to draw the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shutdown_l was a slightly different story as our spy offence took advantage of an uncertain XXX startup and kept things suitably confused for them as we capped twice in the first 10 minutes. They sorted themselves out after that and although we had their
                        lasers down several times, no more caps followed. Our defence was very solid and we managed to keep our lasers up the entire map. Win well/10-10 shutdown_l/20-0.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also played an ill advised friendly vs 187 knowing that 3 of our players were pinging in the 200's on ADSL and 2 others on ISDN had similar problems. K1llz and Proc were doing their impression of Monty Pythons' Judean Peoples Front Suicide Squad by
                        simply running into rooms and exploding. And it turned farcical at one point when our entire offence lagged simultaneously. I still can't believe we played the second map. Scoreline far too embarressing to go into here. <img

                        In an eventful week, TPC bids a fond farewell to FraS, one of our cherished members. After 2 great years with us he decided to look for pastures new. We wish him well. <img src="images/news/smile.gif" />
                        <br />
                        <br /> Sicknote joined us this week, swelling our offensive ranks still further. He promises to add chatter to RW, caps to the scoreboard, and humour to IRC. Welcome Sicky. <img src="images/news/smile.gif" />
                        <br />
                        <br /> Speaking of caps, we beat DA in a friendly during the week in 2 very exciting games on Chimkey 90-60 &amp; Openfire 30-20. As our recruitment continues, we fielded 3 trialists (see Sicknote
                        <img src="images/news/smile.gif" /> ) in this eventful game against our old mucker J5's new clan. We had some connection problems which saw us drop to 6 players on Openfire, so even after an early cap we found ourselves down 10-20.
                        Upon everyones return we capped again, and then clinched the winner in the dying seconds of the map. A Good Game indeed. <img src="images/news/smile.gif" />
                        <br />
                        <br /> And so to the other big news of the week, brought to you in association with Spliff...

                        Had a friendly on Tuesday night V's MDB again. We won 60-0 2fort and 90-0 Monkey. Thanks to MDB for carrying on even though they had 7 men for Monkey. There was also another kind of friendly V's DB on Wednesday, I wasn't there but I understand we were
                        winning when the game was called to a halt for some reason.

                        are looking for older established players with good IRC presence and reasonable TFC skills.

                        40-10 Openfire and 30-10 Well to DW. So we lose are 2nd WPTFCL game. Not very good is it? bah. Openfire was ok, under pressure dropped someone early on, recovered when tuna turned up. Looked like we were going to keep it close but they got a few sneaky
                        caps at end to make score more favourable. Mass TKs by myself and Danny. <img src="images/news/big_grin.gif" /> Well was fun. DW took flag a fair bit and FraS was ffs about people in attic all the time. Anyway
                        they capped and then we equalised. Gooooal. Just about to relay cap out when got killed coming out of window with it. Their flag returned and then DW got a few caps. Balls.
                        <br />

                    <blockquote>
                        I promised myself I'd start a report with something other than "Good game against ..." this time, so here goes...
                        <br />
                        <br /> GrOCam smells.
                        <br />
                        <br /> That's better :). Good game against TPC (d'oh!) on a dodgy WP toaster, some hasty rearranging needed as the Blueyonder - WP connection was crap, meaning Storm and Sin couldn't play :(. We shuffled things around and ended up with
                        3 defenders and 5 attackers - not bad. Biggz and Nest were the lucky O fellows who got to play D, and all in all did a fine job.
                        <br />
                        <br /> We started with Openfire, tough going for our O mongs who praised the TPC defence afterwards. Even so they managed to work a few caps out, including an almost-hole from d00m I believe. Our own defence did well, battery being uber
                        at the switch and Val doing a fine job as engy. I was playing at the water and not doing too well; when TPC moved our flag about halfway through I went demo to hold it up for a while, then just stayed demo for the rest of the game
                        which was fun. Towards the end TPC sent a HWGuy to attack the water which worked pretty well in removing me, but he never made any real headway.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Well was next up, and we decided on me and Biggz at fd, Nest in water, and batt + Val in the fr (doing rude things I'm sure :P) Biggz started as engy before switching to sol, and we made a good pair at the fd - think I might elope
                        with him.
                        <br />
                        <br /> We capped first after what seemed like a dozen touches (but probably wasn't), but not long after TPC got our flag and seemed to have it for ages. I thought they were heading to attic, so I rjumped up there to wait... but they'd
                        gone rr - balcony instead :/. I nailed the medic after he threw and the flag was clear - S H A M B L E S. If I'd stayed rr we possibly could have defended it :/.
                        <br />
                        <br /> At this point Biggz went into attack promising to cap - and did about 2 minutes later, which we followed up with a third a few minutes later :D. TPC realised we only had 1 fd soldier so attacked there more, and I struggled to
                        hold them up. Thankfully Biggz came back on D and helped out, as I was gently sobbing in a corner of the respawn after being 0wned so badly :*(.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Bit of a reshuffle towards the end, Biggz and Nest swapping and Nest teefing my kills and generally outplaying me :).
                        <br />
                        <br /> Defender of the match - possibly battery. Talking to Val after the game he'd shot his load several times watching battery get mid-air rockets on concing meds etc. Well played battery, if you weren't like 1000 miles away I'd lick
                        your lobe :). Saying that, Val was as 0wnage as ever and both Nest and Biggz was supoib, so I think we'll just share the honours around and have a foot-sex orgy. Biggz, don't cancel that room at the Swallow Hotel just yet ;).
                        <br
                        />
                        <br /> Ta for the game TPC, and very well played - it's ages since I've played against you and I'd forgotten how good you are :).

                        Ended in defeat to the hands of D4. 20-0 SD2 and 50-10 2Fort. Not alot to say really. It was a fair result, our defence was outplayed on both maps. A muck up with Roger Wilco meant a total lack of comms together with me needing some desparate prac meant
                        I came away feeling I and the whole defensive team could have played alot better. Oh well roll on the next game. <img src="images/news/smile.gif" /> Hopefully be better prepared next time!

                        Another friendly against MI-CSC brought temporary amusement to our sour and shitty little lives. Once again I find myself dribbling utter bollox on the news page - no one actually reads this - I feel sympathy for them if they do, so... La la la, fuckety
                        fuckety bum, gay sex, wank. First map was Stowaway, and I haven&#8217;t played this in a match situation before; it was slightly spammy, but nether the less enjoyable. MI-CSC managed to break our defence a couple of times to get
                        flag, but our defence was on form, and so we managed to keep it contained.

                    <p>
                        Openfire was not so good, our defence was initially unorganised, and MI-CSC judiciously managed to rack up a ripe score of 4 caps, however, we had the benefit of capital punishment, which is regularly handed out by t!mo, and this kept us spirited, which
                        drove us to equalise. La la la, fuckety fuckety bum, gay sex, wank. Good night.

                        Well I'm off. I dont know how long for, but I will be back in one way or another. Give me a few months to find myself and I'll settle and get net access if my own. I'll email MrG on my progess and let him process the information I send, censor what he
                        sees fit (<img src="images/news/tongue.gif" />) and pass on the rest. Cya TPC, lub joo. :X

                    <p>
                        Bam: TPC - 0 MUF - 0
                        <br />
                        2Fort: TPC - 30 MUF - 30
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both matches were manic, lots of spam, carnage, death, pillage, t!mo spamming the team with orders, (the usual). MUF scared us somewhat by escaping with our flag near the end on Bam, BUT our defence like the crazy sons of a bitches bounced after them,
                        and somehow managed to prevent scorage for the remaining duration of the game. Played defence. Sorry MUF. 2fort close too, we capped, they capped, we capped, they capped, they capped, we capped - my knuckles were bleeding. As ever,
                        thank you MUF for 2 great games.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Also, it gives me much grief to report that a beloved member of the TPC kindred is leaving for America for 2 months. His ghastly presence shall no longer haunt us like a foul stench, and he shall be missed dearly. (The champagne
                        shall be arriving at 8pm tomorrow.) Goodbye Jonny5, from the TPC peeps, hope all the sunbathing will have not been in vain.

                        J5 jets off to America at 5am tomorrow and we wish him the best of luck. WARNING. If you happen to live in America then I advise you to leave straight away. Byeeeeee. <img src="images/news/smile.gif" />
                        <br />
                        <br /> In his final game we played MUF on bam and drew 0-0. The map ended with TPC flag somewhat close to MUF cap point. <img src="images/news/smile.gif" /> Then J5 left us in the lurch and pissed off to the pub.
                        <img src="images/news/big_grin.gif" /> Bagpuss the concing master joined the server and a good game of 2fort insued. 30-30 was the final score with K23 making a good comeback appearance.

                        Bit off topic but I thought I'd pimp this wicked UT mod. I suppose it bares most resemblance to CS but with some improvements to gameplay that make it less of a bunnyhopping DM fest and more like the real thing. It's been going for a while and is in good
                        shape now with newly released beta 1.6.

                        Unrespected member of the community was found dead at his home on June 6th in the early hours of the morning. His mum went to tuck him in and he was found suffocated by his pillow with a sock on his dick (although that is irrelevant).

                        Jonny5 was found dead in his bed this morning, having apparently suffocated. It is unknown as to his cause of death, but he will be sorely missed. It is thought he had an argument with some twat in TPC (FraS), but as of yet no news has been found. Keep
                        on defending Jonny!

                        The server was not shit for 2fort but it was er w@nk on well. Attack was wicked on 2fort and I managed to dive in and get killed at every moment. Fluke didn't lose the flag today so we got all the caps we were meant to. Well was ok and the sniper def
                        was a bit of a shocker. <img src="images/news/tongue.gif" />
                        <br />
                        <br /> Yesterday, HMDC had a mongish def on badlands which meant we got a fair few caps. Snake was his usual self which provided some entertainment. I don't think we had a def on co2 so HMDC capped lots.

                        The game was a friendly vs LoG. Ended up winning 70-60 2fort and 50-0 well. Well played LoG, the scores might have been more in their favour if the server wasn't so bad. A Friendly vs HMDC yesterday saw a win on Badlands and a totally spanking on CO2,

                        We lost to HMDC and beat FA in our last matches. This means we ended around 8th. Not too bad considering shambles we were at start of the season.
                        <br />
                        <br /> We now play because of friendship. We don't have to play if we don't want to. We will only be taking on people who we can get on for next season. That's if we decide to play in it of course.

                        He was a fellow clan mate of mine from LBU. He passed away Sunday morning from unknown causes. I didn't get to know him much but he was a very talented TF player and a top bloke. At the young age of 21 it seems such a waste of life, he had a very bright
                        future infront of him. The people in #lbu wearing the {t} tag on Sunday night shows that he was cared about and shall be missed by many.

                        Wierd things going on at the mo. Main prob is lack of player availability. Something we hope to rectify. We are looking out for a few players but ideally people who know the clan scene and can put some time and effort in. Playing in one league means we
                        aren't very active match wise.
                        <br />
                        <br /> So in summary, old skool but commited people needed.

                        eVil and MrG have left, they have both lost there enjoyment of the game and need to look for pastures new. Two very talented players and loyal TPC peeps, we gonna miss you guys, all the best.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Due to this we are leaving the BarrysWorld league, which is a real shame because we have been in it from the first season and had some great games there.

                        2Fort was a good game.

                        In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers
                        of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.

                        TFH is leaving TFC and TPC. He is going on holiday soon and then returning to France. We wish him the best of luck. A true TPC great.

                    <p>...and crap came flying down.</p>
                    <p>
                        Well it's been a tricky couple of weeks. Haven't really done much in games and so we haven't won. It's annoying but it shows what a strong clan we are. We have the team spirit to take us through this. I'm looking forward to season 3 and the challanges
                        ahead. The new patch has pissed me off but I'm beginning to get used to it, cl_lc 0 and cl_lw 0 have made my TF 1.5 experience more enjoyable.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Monkey update. There seems to be more of these than ever at the moment. It must be this free internet malarky. Luckily the probs redhotant have had have deprived us of some of these gimps for a while.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Q3F. A refreshing change to TFC. Seems so much different. A quality clan is emerging, it's name is vYv. I have to say it has some brilliant players. Paragon, n0ddy, Chastity and Ricey to name a few. If you are interested check
                        their web site.

                        It has come to my attention there are a lot of monkeys out there. This is a special message for u lot. Most of these idiots seem to be about 15 and doing GCSEs. My advice to you guys is get a life. Get a house, car, wife then you will know what life is
                        really like. Rant over.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Been quiet since new patch. Not many matches played. Lost to TFL and IST, drawing a map and losing the other. Games have been really laggy. Hopefully a new patch will fix crap patch and make TF 1.5 like the good old 1016.

                    <p>
                        New release date Monday...
                        <br />
                        <br /> These are the following things I have observed:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Huge change in code. Hitting your jump key 3 times now, will make U jump 3 times, as oppose to the old one, when it would only jump when after the first jump again if U continued pressing till after the first one was finished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (edit - this is not strictly true... only true for aliases (my jump is combined with duck) this suggests therefore, scripts are queued).
                        <br />
                        <br /> Despite the speed decrease on the scout, it seems he can jump further, it is quite easy to take a near diagonal route across the ramps to the lift in 2fort...
                        <br />
                        <br /> Grenades do a wopping 130 points of damage it seems...
                        <br /> meaning a medic is still terrifying on attack. A soldier/demo on attack can take out an SG in a 1gren/1rocket combo. A singular grenade takes an SG down to 20 health!
                        <br />
                        <br /> Rockets also seem to be faster and more powerful... could be wrong though.
                        <br />
                        <br /> A rocket jump doesnt take U much higher... the 2fort lift is reachable as per usual.
                        <br />
                        <br /> The pipes seem to be slightly stronger... I am able to single pipe jump outta the whole on Crossover.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Backpacks and flags can be thrown more freely... IE where U look...
                        <br /> In addition, to prevent people constantly dropping and picking up the flag... a limit has been imposed on time after dropping to picking up...
                        <br />
                        <br /> Concs are (nearly) as powerful, but inderectly...
                        <br />
                        <br /> The blast has been increased, and the push effect is proportional to the distance from the origin... about 2.5 times blokee hight seems to be optimal.
                        <br />
                        <br /> 'On the fly' concs are still possible... but U need to be able to throw the conc downwards for them to work properly... (IE, U must be jumping off something).
                        <br />
                        <br /> Unlike the current version, relative position to the conc is vital, if U run into a detting conc, U will be stopped in yer tracks... in the last version it would sometimes propel U forwards.
                        <br />
                        <br /> The conc effect is also different. Last time Ur screen would wobble, but your aim would stay true if stationary... this has changed... ur vision now moves in a decreasing 'figure of 8'.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Mirv have more push than last time, and the initial blast seems the same... perhaps making it a quite viable escape grenade.
                        <br />
                        <br /> The pyro seems much improved, but I dont know how... it SEEMs like his flames have longer range, burn longer, and do more damage... the incendiary grenade certainly has more bite.
                        <br />
                        <br /> The HW-guy has been fed steriods... he is faster (not really noticeably), and does more damage... a scout is mincemeat in full on fire for any more than a second.
                        <br />
                        <br /> The engy has been modified interestingly. The VGUI runs parrelel with the standard 'biuld menu' which has been phased out, but is still accessible. Facility for rotating the SG DOES exist, but in the VGUI only ATM. Only needed
                        to spanner ur SG to upgrade and reload is a huge improvement...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        EMPs do shedloads of damage, even if all ammo is discarded... killing a scout who could previously survive 3. The EMP blast is wider... therefore making the engi the primary candidate for the ammo bags.
                        <br />
                        <br /> SGs seem to turn slower... and have no detection range increase... although whether this is increased when locked is another matter
                        <br /> A HW-guy can go head to head with a LVL II, AC vs all its got... and just about win... they seem more vulnerable... circle strafing will be more difficult now, in that U overtake the SG and it gets a lock.
                        <br />
                        <br /> The spy has been made a LOT more powerful, but VERY discretely... the ability to change colour and skin simultaenously is scary... meaning infiltration will be easier... combined with the damage from grens, and his nailgun, he
                        should be formidable... the only set back is the way I cant find the commands to do this, to seperate them from the VGUI! aaar...
                    </p>
                    <p>The spy's tranq seems less long lived... but the knife is supposedly a guaranteed kill to the back, regardless of class (HW-guys and solds could survive).</p>
                    <p>
                        The sniper is more dangerous for many reasons... less charge time (I think) and a sharper net code mean the opens will be full of em. The dot is smaller, and the code for the mouse inputs has been heavily streamlined (I had a look in the CFGs - EEK at
                        all the mouse functions).
                    </p>
                    <p>The new score board is nice... giving details of class and more space for name... your text is defaulted to team colour also.</p>
                    <p>
                        The comms system will be intresting... I prefer mine ATM, but the one text file, all maps, almost code like interface could provide some interesting opportunies for making a clan universal comms scheme (I am working on this now).
                    </p>
                    <p>The new maps suck pretty badly I'm afraid... looking like CS rejects and playing worse...</p>
                    <p>Many of the map bugs (such as door trick and bags) have been patched out, as has the demo script (WOO!).</p>
                    <p>One interesting thing, that is likely enterely unrelated, is the player animations...</p>
                    <p>I had gaitestimation turned off in the last patch to decrease lag... it seems it has been implemented properly now... with players sliding around on one foot if it is off...</p>
                    <p>OpenGL support has been augmented... but the fonts on D3D mode are horrible, often being garbled... the new 'true type fonts' that scale to resolution are useful, but a curse for D3D users like me...</p>
                    <p>Support for LEDs has been removed, as has ASCII code...</p>
                    <p>Support for the num pad has been implemented with the prefix of KP_ to the key (KP_PLUS, KP_8) etc...</p>
                    <p>
                        Hullucination etc have gone client side... this should be interesting... the net code in itself is going to be a completely different kettle o fish... as most of the code is client side... meaning a horribly lagged person simply delays in killing U...
                        as oppose to just not killing U at all...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think thats it (GASP) more later.

                    </p>
                    <p>Well the new patch to make TFC, TF 1.5 is due out this week. I've got my hand on a leaked version and concs are well difficult.</p>
                    <p>
                        BTW forgot to mention second UKSL result. We drew with .exe.

                        <br />
                        <br /> A valiant effort on FS2 got the flag to the window but a heavy defence in the closing minutes meant we couldn't take BA to CZ2. We lost to a good team who we get on with so it's not that bad.

                        The flash intro is mind boggling. Their forums are tremendous and have lots of activity, I like the way Reality seems to talk to himself. ;)

                        Last Sunday we played out first game outside of Wireplay against [TGC] in the UKSL.
                        <br />

                        <br />
                        <br /> Regardless of some connection and server problems it was hell of a top game that remained tight and frantic throughout.

                        Recently I've received a lot of enquiries about trials. I want to set the record straight.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Please take a look at this page.

                        We are looking for you to obey these kind of things, however, I will do our own TPC version soon.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Do not come onto the server and ask for trial.
                        <br /> Email and ICQ me first.
                        <br /> I would like an email stating why you want to join TPC.
                        <br /> What classes you are best at.
                        <br /> I don't want to hear stuff like I do anything. Be specific.
                        <br /> I want to know your age.
                        <br /> Why did you leave your old clan?
                        <br /> We do not play at weekends.
                        <br />
                        <br /> I could go on and on.

                        <br /> I want to clear up a few things, TPC is a small clan and we require people with the right attitude. TFC skills are not enough. We don't like weekends therefore you will have to available for weeknights. We need you to use ICQ,
                        IRC, email.
                        <br />

                        Tonights league match against [RoD] saw us back to our match winning form with only 7 players.
                        <br />
                        <br /> We won both matches (Well 60-0, Rock 30-0) whilst experimenting with some new tactics implemented after last nights beating! Unfortunately our score wasn't as high as we would of hoped but with practice that will come.

                    <p>
                        Sad to say but we were well and truly beaten tonight in our first friendly match for a while. [FUNK] beat us in both games (2Fort &amp; Well) by 30 points to 0.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Tonight also saw our three newest members (Scoop, FraS and Skitzo) in action for the first time.

                        After last weeks low scoring game against CJK, we have got our capping back online. Tonights match vs U4 resulted in a combined score of 250-0, nice one peeps!
                        <br />
                        <br /> This weeks star award is shared between Boggot and Curtis. Their relentless support of Badger in attack led directly to the high number of caps we managed to score. Well done.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Once again Babe2000 has to get a special mention this week, this time for the copious quantities of jam she produced for the clan whilst defending the attic. BTW, Behemoth and Rat managed to tidy up and decorate the flagroom whilst
                        they were in there, so I hope you will keep it tidy from now on (any fagends and cigars butts should be taken home with you or discarded outside).

                        Just finished our clan match vs CJK. After all the hype the result was 2 draws (30-30 0-0). Everyone had connection problems which added to the mayhem. Unfortunately this is the end of our clean sheet, but we are still unbeaten.

                        <br /> Good game though, thanks to everyone on both clans for the top rate play. We only hope that that is the hardest match of our division!!

                        Tuesday night's league match against BRR resulted in yet another clean sheet for us. Well done everyone for an excellent game and for managing to turn up for the 7 PM match. Escpecial thanks go to Mr. StickFloat for allowing Badger the time for the match.

                        Thanks to DTE for the friendly clan match last night. Unfortunately DTE only managed to field 6 players, so borrowed our reserves (Ricey &amp; Babe2000) for the match.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Well was a bit of a nightmare and resulted in a 0-0 draw, however during 2Fort we got our act together and pulled off a magnificent 90-20 win!
                        <br />
                        <br /> The new Admin commands supplied by Kryten and Splash did the trick and I am happy to report that the server reset problem appears to be a thing of the past.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Once again I would like to thank DTE for our last practice match before the league starts and we look forward to meeting you 'for real' in two weeks time .<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>

                        <br /> I would also like to suggest that all clan members use ICQ (see link on this page). It is an excellent communications tool and well worth the download.

                        We are a LAN based clan with five core members and an additional four to five members depending on who is in the country at the time.
                        <br />
                        <br /> We have been playing TFC since the LAN release.
                        <br />
                        <br /> We have five decent PCs but only two decent phone lines which is a distinct disadvantage as we are playing more on the net (Wireplay).
                        <br />
                        <br /> So we would like to hear from any FUN lovers who want to join a TFC clan to play in the Wireplay league and other friendy matches, or people in the Dorset area interested in a LAN party.
                        <br />
                        <br /> We are not after good players just people that are team players and can play on a regular basis.
