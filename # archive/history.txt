April 1999 - December 1999 

[TPC] The Poo Crew started off life as a LAN based clan in the Dorset area playing the
Half-Life modification Team Fortress Classic. Badger and Slog then founded the clan on the Internet, recruited some excellent players and joined the Wireplay League were we got through to the quarter-finals and lost in a very close game against HB.

Due to Badger's and Slog's other commitments they could no longer run the clan. If it wasn't for Badger and Slog the clan wouldn't of existed and the great bunch of people that play in it would have never met each other, we miss these guys and wish them the best of luck in what ever they do in the future.

Now renamed to [TPC] Tactical Precision Crew and under the new management of t!mo and RAT the clan has a bright future that will aim to win and do its best and more importantly have fun.

January 2000 - March 2001

Many games won and lost, people come and gone. In season2 of the Wireplay League we got through to the gold knockouts but got knocked out in first round by BA. In season3 of the Wireplay League the format changed to a proper style and we placed in the premier division and came 4th overall. We were very confident as a clan now and branched out into the 'net' leagues and entered the UKTFCL and the Barrysworld League. In season1 of the Barrysworld league we came 2nd in our pool. In season2 we came 10th of the premiership division. We dropped out near the beginning of season3 due to member shortage. We joined the UKTFCL when it was on it's 5th season and were placed in the premiership division amongst some the top clans around Europe. We finished 8th. In season6 we were in the premiership division again but halfway through had to drop out due to member shortage.

So after our little adventurers we are now going back to our roots. We are once again a Wireplay League only clan and have renamed ourselves back to [TPC] The Poo Crew. We have regular meet ups and have a good tight community of players that enjoy playing TFC to a high standard.
